# MSC_Gratton_2017_Codebase
4.9.2018, CG

This folder contains code to run analyses in:
Gratton et al., (2018) Functional Brain Networks Are Dominated by Stable Group and Individual Factors, Not Cognitive or Daily Variation. Neuron

for summary instructions, see:
README_taskconnectivity.txt
README_taskactivation.txt

this code depends on data processed for Gordon et al., 2017, Neuron:
Gordon et al., (2017) Precision functional mapping of individual human brains. Neuron, 95(4), 791-807

and available through openfMRI:
https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000224/

with additional relevant code available through github:

Additionally, this code uses the following WUSTL packages for analysis:
- 4dfp tools: a set of tools for neuroimaging analysis developed by A.Z. Snyder
  see: ftp://imaging.wustl.edu/pub/raichlab/4dfp_tools/4dfp_release.txt
- FIDL: functional neuroimaging task analysis software written in IDL and developed at WashU
  see: http://www.nil.wustl.edu/~fidl/
- Connectome Workbench functions and utilities
  see: https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench

This code base includes tools for FC processing of task data and principle analyses from the manuscript. The code is provided "as is", without any warranty. We can not provide techinical support for the code. For general questions, please contact Caterina Gratton (cgratton@wustl.edu).
